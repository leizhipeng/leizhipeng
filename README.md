I am **Zhipeng Lei**, an engineer with passion to learn innovative technologies. 
I received a PHD in Mechanical Engineering and am currently a researcher in an U.S. national laboratory.
In my spare time, I have developped open-source projects for learning various skills such as Python, Deep Learning, and Data Science.
